Track 1 : Student Lifestyle

**Problem Statement**

University students struggle to access affordable and personalized academic support, often facing difficulties in finding qualified tutors and reliable study resources. Existing platforms are costly, inflexible, and lack interactive tools, leaving students stressed during exams and deadlines. BiliTutor aims to bridge this gap by offering an on-demand, affordable tutoring platform.
